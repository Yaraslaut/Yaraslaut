= Symmary
I am a physicist specializing in theoretical physics, currently pursuing my Ph.D. in optics. With a strong background in the field, I combine theory and numerical calculations to study the light-matter interaction.

= Hobbies and interests

#set list(marker: [â€¢])
- I contribute to terminal emulator #link("https://github.com/contour-terminal/contour")[Contour] which I use daily, I especially enjoy the sixel support, thanks to which I have no need to leave the terminal when making plots of any kind.
- I have a small pet project #link("https://github.com/Yaraslaut/prop")[Prop] 2D FDTD solver of Maxwell's equations, it can utilize both CPU and GPU for calculations, while the math part is written in C++, Python wrapper also exist to give users easy access to the software.
