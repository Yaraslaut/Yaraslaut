= Summary
I am a physicist specializing in theoretical physics, currently pursuing my Ph.D. in nonlinear optics. With a strong background in the field, I combine theory and numerical calculations to study the light-matter interaction of different materials. For example, interaction of graphene with structured light and other materials such as Weyl semimetals of different types. Beyond my academic pursuits, I actively contribute to a few projects that I personally utilize on a daily basis. And have some small pet projects that allow me to explore new ideas and continuously expand my knowledge.

= Hobbies and interests

#set list(marker: [â€¢])
- I contribute to terminal emulator #link("https://github.com/contour-terminal/contour")[Contour] which I use daily, I especially enjoy the Sixel support, thanks to which I have no need to leave the terminal when making plots of any kind.
- I have a small pet project #link("https://github.com/Yaraslaut/prop")[Prop] 2D FDTD solver of Maxwell's equations, it can utilize both CPU and GPU for calculations, while the math part is written in C++, Python wrapper also exists to give users easy access to the software.
